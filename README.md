Task 1 involves creating a JavaScript file named arrayManipulation.js and defining a function called processArray. 
This function takes an array of numbers as its input and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled. 
Essentially, it's about manipulating an array of numbers based on certain conditions and producing a transformed array as output.

Moving on to Task 2, the focus shifts to enhancing the functionality of arrayManipulation.js by introducing a new function named formatArrayStrings. 
This function operates on two arrays: an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by the processArray function from Task 1. 
Its purpose is to modify each string in the input array based on the corresponding number in the number array. If the number is even, the string is capitalized; 
if odd, it's converted to lowercase. This task broadens the manipulation capability to include string formatting based on numeric conditions.

Finally, Task 3 extends the functionality further by introducing a new JavaScript file named userInfo.js. 
In this file, a function called createUserProfiles is defined. This function takes two arrays as input: an array of names and an array of modified names generated by the formatArrayStrings function from Task 2. 
Its role is to create user profiles, each represented as an object containing the original name, the modified name, and an auto-incremented ID starting from 1. Essentially, 
Task 3 completes the workflow by integrating the name manipulation and profile creation processes, providing a comprehensive solution for generating user profiles based on manipulated data.
